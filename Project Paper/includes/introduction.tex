Climate scientists are interested in modeling aspects of our planet's ecosystem,
creating a number of simulations to do so. One such simulation is the Large Eddy
Simulator (LES) developed by Hiromasa Nakayama and Haruyasu Nagai at the Japan
Atomic Energy Agency and Professor Tetsuya Takemi at the Disaster Prevention
Research Institute of Kyoto University. The original LES is implemented in
FORTRAN 77 and is single threaded.

With multicore processors and multiple processors available on a single machine,
it is beneficial to parallelise the LES to make better use of the computation
power of a shared memory system. With multiple node systems common place in the
area of research simulation, a parallelised implementation of the LES that can
make use of distributed memory system hardware is highly desirable.

Work by Wim Vanderbauwhede has seen the LES automatically ported for Fortran 95
and an OpenCL implementation created. While this improves performance on shared
memory systems and allows the use of heterogeneous systems such as those with
GPUs to be used, the LES may not have the best possible performance on a CPU and
it is still not ready for distributed memory systems.

This paper presents two implementations of the LES. The first uses the industry
standard for distributed memory parallelism, MPI, and the second makes use of a
new framework by Wim Vanderbauwhede, the Glasgow Model Coupling Framework
(GMCF). The GMCF implementation is shared memory only as the framework is still
in the early stages of development with future work that includes the ability to
have distributed memory parallelism.

The major contributions of the work discussed in this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MPI implementation of the LES
    \item Evaluation of MPI LES
    \item GMCF implementation of the LES
    \item Evaluation of GMCF LES
    \item GMCF performance investigation and improvements
\end{itemize}

Section~\ref{sec:Background} discusses the background to GMCF.
Section~\ref{sec:MPILES} discusses the MPI implementation of the LES with
Section~\ref{sec:MPILESEval} conducting a shared-memory and distributed-memory
performance evaluation. Section~\ref{sec:GMCFLES} then discusses the GMCF
implementation including framework changes required to facilitate model
parallelisation with Section~\ref{sec:GMCFLESEval} conducting a shared-memory
performance evaluation. Section~\ref{sec:GMCFInvestigation} conducts an in-depth
performance investigation of the GMCF framework while outlining
performance-related improvements implemented. Section~\ref{sec:Conclusion} then
concludes, discussing future work for GMCF and the LES.

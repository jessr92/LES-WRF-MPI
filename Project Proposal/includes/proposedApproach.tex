As stated before, there are a number of distinct stages to the project and each
stage requires a different approach.

The first stage involves creating a distributed version of the LES. This will
use MPI since it is the \textit{de facto} standard for cross-process
communication and OASIS3-MCT uses MPI1 capabilities for the coupling itself.
Even though OASIS3-MCT itself is limited to MPI1 capabilities, there should be
no issue using MPI2, or even MPI3 capabilities for the model-local parallelism
since MPI is mostly backward compatible. The dummy OASIS3-MCT coupling created
as part of the feasibility study was compiled with MPICH 3.1.2, an MPI3 capable
library, without issue.

The first stages second task involves coupling LES with WRF. For each timestep
of WRF, LES will run about one hundred times before data is exchanged. This will
need to be expressed in the coupling mechanism to avoid unnecessary data
transfers and minimal requirement for I/O operations. There are also potential
problems with modifying WRF for the OASIS coupling since WRF is a highly complex
piece of software and thus making changes, especially with a lack of experience
with the code base, could be challenging.

The second stage is the evaluation of performance which will have two parts:
evaluating the MPI LES and the coupled system performance as node count
increases, perhaps with different MPI implementations (say MPICH and OpenMPI).
MPI libraries aren't strictly interchangeable however with the availability of
the wrapper compiler \textit{mpifort} mixing MPI implementations may be
straightforward.

The third stage involves comparing the differences in performance of the
OASIS3-MCT coupling to the GMCF coupling. GMCF is in a proof-of-concept stage
however has already been used to couple OpenMP WRF with the OpenCL accelerated
LES variant successfully.

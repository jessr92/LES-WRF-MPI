From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not knownif they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition ...},

This paper presents a user-level virtual machine (VM) approach to MPI program execution in an Internet sharing framework. In this approach, the resource consumer has its own operating system running on top of and isolated from, the operating system of the resource provider. We propose an efficient socket virtualization technique to optimize VM network performance. Socket virtualization achieves the same network bandwidth as the physical network. In our LAN environment, it reduces the latency overhead from 112\% (using existing TUN/TAP technique) to 35.6\%. Performance results on MPI benchmarks show that our virtualization technique incurs small overhead compared with the physical host platform, while gaining in return a higher degree of guest isolation and customization. We also describe the key mechanisms that allow the employment of VMs in an existing Internet sharing system},

Although non-blocking collective operations are an obvious extension to MPI, there have been no comprehensive studies of this functionality. In this paper we present LibNBC, a portable high-performance library for implementing non-blocking collective MPI communication operations. LibNBC provides non-blocking versions of all MPI collective operations, is layered on top of MPI-1, and is portable to nearly all parallel architectures. To measure the performance characteristics of our implementation, we also present a microbenchmark for measuring both latency and overlap of computation and communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the blocking performance of the collective operations in our library is comparable to that of collective operations in other high-performance MPI implementations. Our library introduces a very low overhead between the application and the underlying MPI and thus, in conjunction with the potential to overlap communication with computation, offers the potential for optimizing real-world applications.},

Existing approaches are typically based on manual or compiler-based transformations. This paper presents a pattern and library-based approach to optimizing collective communication in parallel high-performance applications, based on using non-blocking collective operations to enable overlapping of communication and computation. Common communication and computation patterns in iterative SPMD computations are used to motivate the transformations we present. Our approach provides the programmer with the capability to separately optimize communication and computation in an application, while automating the interaction between computation and communication to achieve maximum overlap. Performance results results with two model applications show more than 90\% decrease in communication overhead, resulting in 16\% and 21\% overall performance improvements.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Sparse linear algebra is a key component of many scientific computations such as computational fluid dynamics, mechanical engineering or the design of new materials to mention only a few. The discretization of complex geometries in unstructured meshes leads to sparse matrices with irregular patterns. Their distribution in turn results in irregular communication patterns within parallel operations. In this paper, we show how sparse linear algebra can be implemented effortless on distributed memory architectures. We demonstrate how simple it is to incorporate advanced partitioning, network topology mapping, and data migration techniques into parallel HPC programs by establishing novel abstractions. For this purpose, we developed a linear algebra library - Parallel Matrix Template Library 4 - based on generic and meta-programming introducing a new paradigm: meta-tuning. The library establishes its own domain-specific language embedded in C++. The simplicity of software development is not paid by lower performance. Moreover, the incorporation of topology mapping demonstrated performance improvements up to 29\%. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Many large-scale parallel programs follow a bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) structure with distinct computation and communication phases. Although the communication phase in such programs may involve all (or large numbers) of the participating processes, the actual communication operations are usually sparse in nature. As a result, communication phases are typically expressed explicitly using point-to-point communication operations or collective operations. We define the dynamic sparse data-exchange (DSDE) problem and derive bounds in the well known LogGP model. While current approaches work well with static applications, they run into limitations as modern applications grow in scale, and as the problems that are being solved become increasingly irregular and dynamic.$\backslash$nTo enable the compact and efficient expression of the communication phase, we develop suitable sparse communication protocols for irregular applications at large scale. We discuss different irregular applications and show the sparsity in the communication for$\backslash$nreal-world input data.We discuss the time and memory complexity of commonly used protocols for the DSDE problem and develop NBX—a novel fast algorithm with constant memory overhead for solving it. Algorithm NBX improves the runtime of a sparse data-$\backslash$nexchange among 8,192 processors on BlueGene/P by a factor of 5.6.

@article{Thakur2009,
abstract = {As parallel systems are commonly being built out of increasingly large multicore chips, application programmers are exploring the use of hybrid programming models combining MPI across nodes and multithreading within a node. Many MPI implementations, however, are just starting to support multithreaded MPI communication, often focussing on correctness first and performance later. As a result, both users and implementers need some measure for evaluating the multithreaded performance of an MPI implementation. In this paper, we propose a number of performance tests that are motivated by typical application scenarios. These tests cover the overhead of providing the MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE level of thread safety for user programs, the amount of concurrency in different threads making MPI calls, the ability to overlap communication with computation, and other features. We present performance results with this test suite on several platforms (Linux cluster, Sun and IBM SMPs) and MPI implementations (MPICH2, Open MPI, IBM, and Sun). ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Larson2005,
abstract = {Many problems in science and engineering are best simulated as a set of mutually interacting models, resulting in a coupled or multiphysics model. These models present challenges stemming from their interdisciplinary nature and from their computational and algorithmic complexities. The computational complexity of individual models, combined with the popularity of the distributed-memory parallel programming model used on commodity microprocessor-based clusters, results in a parallel coupling problem when building a coupled model. We define and elucidate this problem and how it results in a set of requirements for software capable of simplifying the construction of parallel coupled models. We describe the package, the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT), which we have developed to meet these general requirements and the specific requirements of a parallel climate model. We present the MCT programming model with illustrative code examples. We present representative results that measure MCT's scalability, performance portability, and a proxy for coupling overhead.},

@article{Zhao2013,
abstract = {Many new large-scale applications have emerged recently and become important in areas such as bioinformatics and social networks. These applications are often data-intensive and involve irregular communication patterns and complex operations on remote processes. Active messages have proven effective for parallelizing such nontraditional applications. However, most current active messages frameworks are low-level and system specific, do not efficiently support asynchronous progress, and are not interoperable with two-sided and collective communications. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an active messages framework inside MPI to provide portability and programmability, and we explore challenges when asynchronously handling active messages and other messages from the network as well as from shared memory. We test our implementation with a set of comprehensive benchmarks. Evaluation results show that our framework has the advantages of overlapping and interoperability, while introducing only a modest overhead.},
